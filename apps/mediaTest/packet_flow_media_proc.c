 Description

   Source code for "packet / media thread" packet and media processing

 Purposes

   1) Provide multithread capability in SigSRF software, enabling fully concurrent multiple packet streams, codecs, and jitter buffers

   2) Per thread, implement SigSRF library APIs to provide packet flow/media processing functionality, test, and measurement, and transcoding, including:

      -multiple RFC compliant packet flow, advanced jitter buffer, DTX handling, DTMF event handling, multichannel packets, ptime conversion, and more
      -measurements, including:
        -x86 server performance
        -verify bitexactness for codecs, measure audio quality.  Interoperate at encoded bitstream level with 3GPP test vectors and reference codes
        -packet loss and other packet statistics

   3) Implement push/pull packet queues to allow applications, including mediaMin, to use only a small, minimal subset of the SigSRF API

      -support stress and capacity testing by applications by providing a cmd line option to open multiple mediaMin app threads
      -support UDP network socket packet data flow both directly and via push/pull queues

   4) Implement insertion points for application and user-defined signal processing and deep learning

   5) Act as key source code component of the SigSRF SDK, providing API source code examples, including correct transcoding data flow and API usage for SigSRF libs including pktlib, voplib, streamlib, diaglib, and aviolib

   6) Provide basis for limited, demo/eval version available on Github

 Revision History

   Created Jul 2018 JHB, separated packet mode processing section from x86_mediaTest.c.  See revision history in x86_mediaTest.c

   Modified Jun CKJ 2017, added support for simultaneously using input pcap files of different link layer types 
                          added support for ipv6 in pcap extract mode, added check to exit cleanly if internet layer is not ipv4 or ipv6
   Modified Jun 2017 JHB, added pcap to wav support, single exit point for success + most errors in pcap extract mode
   Modified Jun 2017 JHB, added pcap and jitter buffer stats logging
   Modified Jun 2017 JHB, added frame mode option for pcap input (see "packet mode" and "frame mode" comments)
   Modified Jul 2017 JHB, modified packet info log to group data by SSRC.  Currently a max of 8 unique SSRCs are supported in one session
   Modified Jul 2017 JHB, added multithread operation test code (see ENABLE_MULTITHREAD_OPERATION)
   Modified Jul 2017 JHB, added DSOpenPcap(), DSReadPcapRecord(), and DSWritePcapRecord() APIs to consolidate and reduce pcap file handling code
   Modified Jul 2017 CKJ, moved pcap file related structs and functions to pktlib
   Modified Jul 2017 JHB, added example showing use of DS_GETORD_PKT_RETURN_ALL_DELIVERABLE flag for multiple SSRC streams within the same session.  The flag is applied briefly to force remaining packets for the current stream out of the buffer when a new stream starts
   Modified Aug 2017 JHB, fixed problem in .cod to .wav conversion (codec test mode) where varying frame sizes were not handled correctly
   Modified Aug 2017 CKJ, added mode to test / demonstrate background process (see ALLOW_BACKGROUND_PROCESS and use_bkgnd_process)
   Modified Aug 2017 JHB, added DTX handling example, using the termN.flags field in session config files to enable/disable.  Default is enabled (flags has TERM_DTX_ENABLED set).  If not enabled a one-time message is printed when mediaTest runs.  If enabled the packet stats log file will show both SID and "SID Reuse" packets in the output stream
   Modified Sep 2017 CKJ, added DTMF handling example per RFC4733, including DTMF event processing and output packet forwarding.  In the packet stats log, look for packets labeled "DTMF Event"
   Modified Oct 2017 CKJ, added variable ptime handling and use of DSStoreStreamData() and DSGetStreamData() APIs.  Decoupled stream data processing from ordered buffering, highlight user-defined media data processing insertion point
   Modified Jun 2018 CKJ, add audio stream merging; see stream group API usage (such as DSAttachStreamToGroup) and code at "media processing insertion point"
   Modified Jul 2018 CKJ, change LIB_LOG_TO_FILE define to general case LOG_OUTPUT and use the Log_RT() file + screen output constants defined in diaglib.h
   Modified Jul 2018 CKJ, modify get_wav_index() to select correct channel from current session (when multiple sessions are active)
   Modified Jul 2018 JHB, create GetMergeInfo() and DisableStreamMerging() local functions and otherwise simplify and reduce stream merging source code example
   Modified Jul 2018 JHB, add references to executionMode to handle differences in command line vs. thread execution.  Add calls to DSRecvPackets() and DSSendPackets() for thread execution
   Modified Jul 2018 JHB, implement changes that make packet processing less dependent on input stream index, which allows packets to arrive in any order from any stream.  These include:
                            -modify CheckForSSRCChange() to use packet's channel number instead of stream index to keep track of SSRC changes (chan number is determined by packet hashing, parent channel is used for dynamic channels)
                            -a few places where channel number can be used for indexing instead of stream number
   Modified Aug 2018 JHB, modifications to allow this file to be included in pklib build, in order to support the DSPushPackets() and DSPullPackets() minimum API interface with packet_flow_media_proc() running as a thread.  These include
                            -eliminate warnings in the pktlib build which uses -Wall
                            -use of __LIBRARYMODE__ for a few sections of code that not be included in .so build
   Modified Aug 2018 JHB, fix merged output pcap timestamp problem (see merge_timestamp)
   Modified Aug 2018 JHB, in pktlib thread build (__LIBRARYMODE__ defined), eliminate I/O related code and most global vars
   Modified Aug 2018 JHB, add initial support for on-the-fly session create/delete, including InitSession() and InitStream() functions
   Modified Aug 2018 JHB, add sub loop for cases where DSRecvPackets() returns more than one packet
   Modified Sep 2018 JHB, implement "master buffer" scheme for stream audio merging.  This allows stream contributions at unequal and varying rates.  The default "allowable gap" for lagging streams is 1/4 sec, but can be set up to 8 sec via DS_SESSION_INFO_MERGE_BUFFER_SIZE
   Modified Sep 2018 JHB, further refinement to stream audio merging (i) ensure exact time-alignment and start offset of all streams, and (ii) fill in missing contributions with audio zeros under certain conditions
   Modified Sep 2018 JHB, debug and test multiple merge groups.  Add merge group initialization to InitSession()
   Modified Oct 2018 JHB, implement multiple packet/media threads.  Modifications / optimizations include thread_index initialization, ManageSessions(), get_session_handle(), ThreadDebugOutput(), sig_printf(), isMasterThread references, etc
   Modified Oct 2018 JHB, additional error checking for cases when asynchronous pkt/media threads may be concurrently processing same stream groups
   Modified Oct 2018 JHB, optimize usage of DSGetStreamData(). This also fixed a crash case with multiple pkt/media threads "seeing" each other's active channels.  See USE_CHAN_NUMS define and associated comments
   Modified Nov 2018 JHB, move merging related codes to streamlib.so (streamlib.c).  streamlib API calls here include DSInitMergeGroup() and DSMergeStreamGroupContributors()
   Modified Nov 2018 JHB, add CheckForDormantSSRC() to detect and flush channels with dormant SSRCs that are "taken over" by another channel, for example due to call-waiting or on-hold situations
   Modified Dec 2018 JHB, add packet/media thread energy saver mode (see fThreadInputActive and fThreadOutputActive flags and comments below about CPU usage)
   Modified Dec 2018 JHB, improve ThreadDebugOutput() to show group info for any thread sessions attached to a group.  Notes:
                          -this is needed to see exact effects of the STREAM_GROUP_WHOLE_THREAD_ALLOCATE and DS_CONFIG_MEDIASERVICE_ROUND_ROBIN flags (streamlib.h and pktlib.h)
                          -correct whole group allocation requires STREAM_GROUP_WHOLE_THREAD_ALLOCATE to be added to the term1 group mode field at session creation time, and DS_CONFIG_MEDIASERVICE_ROUND_ROBIN flag to be set when creating a packet/media thread. Without the round robin flag there can still be some groups split across threads
                          -see the nomenclature comments in ThreadDebugOutput() to interpret the screen output
   Modified Dec 2018 JHB, more info printed in ThreadDebugOutput(), including some system wide stats
   Modified Feb 2019 JHB, add DS_GETORD_PKT_ENABLE_SID_REPAIR usage.  Applying this flag enables "CNG fill-in" when damage to long silence durations is detected (audio that contains long SID periods can be significantly shortened/mis-aligned by packet loss.  Test with 13572.0 pcap)
   Modified Feb 2019 JHB, add RecordPacketTimeStats() to keep track of packet timestamp and RTP timestamp duration (both before and after jitter buffer)
   Modified Feb 2019 JHB, add CheckForPacketLossFlush() for packet loss mitigation (monitors jitter buffer levels for parent and child channels).  See max_loss_ptimes in TERMINATION_INFO struct (shared_include/session.h)
   Modified Mar 2019 JHB, add packet time and loss stats.  See PACKET_TIME_STATS define, see also fPacketTimeStatsEnabled and fPacketLossStatsEnabled in PACKETMEDIATHREADINFO struct and DS_CONFIG_MEDIASERVICE_EN/DISABLE_THREAD_PACKET_TIME/LOSS_STATS flags (pktlib.h)
   Modified Mar 2019 JHB, improve profiling, give each category its own independent running sum index and increase running sum length to 16 (THREAD_STATS_TIME_MOVING_AVG defined in pktlib.h)
   Modified May 2019 JHB, when acting on payload content type returned by DSGetOrderedPackets(), check for both DS_PKT_PYLD_CONTENT_DTMF_SESSION (indicating a match to a session-defined DTMF payload type), and for generic DS_PKT_PYLD_CONTENT_DTMF content type
   Modified Aug 2019 JHB, add extern C to definition of functions used externally (sig_printf, ResetPktStats), limit number of channels that can be tracked in profiling (see MAX_CHAN_TRACKED below), add an error string param to ThreadAbort()
   Modified Sep 2019 JHB, fix incorrect nDormantChanFlush[] indexing and one case of nOnHoldChanFlush[] incorrect indexing:  session + term based, not channel
   Modified Sep 2019 JHB, remove sig_sprintf() function, no longer used
   Modified Sep 2019 JHB, change include folder for udp.h and ip.h from "linux" to "netinet" to fix -Wodr (one definition rule) warning with gcc 5.4.  Remove if_ether.h and arpa/inet.h includes (already in pktlib.h)
   Modified Oct 2019 JHB, implement pastdue in CheckForPacketLossFlush()
   Modified Oct 2019 JHB, act on STREAM_GROUP_OVERFLOW_STOP_GROUP_ON_DETECTION flag (one of overrun compensation related flags added to shared_include/streamlib.h). More detailed info in warning message if DSStoreStreamGroupContributorData() returns -1
   Modified Dec 2019 JHB, make pkt_counters[] global (needed in packet.c), include chnum and idx information in PKT_STATS collection (see DSGetStreamGroupInfo() with DS_GETGROUPINFO_HANDLE_CHNUM flag)
   Modified Dec 2019 JHB, implement DSWritePacketStatsHistoryLog() and DSLogPacketTimeLossStats() APIs.  The latter collates, formats, and prints run-time packet stats to the event log
   Modified Jan 2020 JHB, use DSGetStreamGroupInfo() when collecting packet history stats (PKT_STATS), ensure run-time packet stats are not logged twice for same session prior to deletion
   Modified Jan 2020 JHB, define SECONDARY_THREADS_DEPRECATED, which deprecates old "secondary thread" code.  Since early 2018, packet_flow_media_proc() is thread-safe and allows multiple packet/media "worker" threads.  Multiple app threads are implemented using mediaTest -Et ant -tN cmd line options, which invoke one or more mediaMin application threads
   Modified Jan 2020 JHB, call DSCreateFilelibThread() in p/m thread initialization.  See comments in filelib.h and filemgr.cpp
   Modified Jan 2020 JHB, implement p/m thread preemption alarm
   Modified Jan-Feb 2020 JHB, disallow past due flush if the channel's jb output is currently in SID state.  This avoids generation of possibly extra SID reuse packets and leaves the SID reuse responsibility completely with pktlib packet repair
   Modified Feb 2020 JHB, optimize jitter output packet processing loop and stream data loop (after variable ptime):  obtain decoder codec handle, termInfo, termInfo_link, etc only if chnum changes between loop iterations (see prev_chnum)
   Modified Feb 2020 JHB, improve p/m thread preemption alarm logic, add profile times and other stats in preemption event log messages
   Modified Mar 2020 JHB, fix dormant session countdown which was hardwired to a constant, but should be equal to jitter buffer target delay
   Modified Mar 2020 JHB, fix consecutive same-channel packet (channel burst) stat, which was not being recorded correctly
   Modified Mar 2020 JHB, move session flush check before session delete check in ManageSessions()
   Modified Mar 2020 JHB, implement TERM_EXPECT_BIDIRECTIONAL_TRAFFIC flag in receive queue handling, which reduces calls to DSRecvPackets() with DS_RECV_PKT_QUEUE_COPY (look ahead) flag set. This increases performance for unidirectional traffic (analytics mode)
   Modified Mar 2020 JHB, add case to pastdue processing for sessions not a stream group member
   Modified Apr 2020 JHB, move session_info_thread[] to pktlib, instead of being on the stack for each p/m thread. Remove session_info_thread[] param from several functions
   Modified Apr 2020 JHB, in telecom mode set last_pull_time[] only if DSGetOrderedPackets() returns non-zero, instead of each time it's called as in analytics mode
   Modified Apr 2020 JHB, modify pastdue processing to use instantaneous jitter buffer number of packets (see DS_JITTER_BUFFER_INFO_NUM_PKTS usage in pktlib.h, rtp_jubf.c)
   Modified Apr 2020 JHB, fix pkt_ptr increment bug in packet processing loop following DSGetOrderedPackets() (loop decodes and stores stream data). See comment near end of loop
   Modified Apr 2020 JHB, new support for telecom mode and hybrid analytics/telecom mode:
                          -DSGetOrderedPackets() post processing to maintain jitter buffer mem usage limits (see comments)
                          -rewrite CheckForDormantSSRC() to handle all modes and termN endpoints. This includes the addition of last_buffer_time[]
                          -new jitter buffer run-time stats added, including max packets, resyncs, and overrun buffer percent full
   Modified Apr 2020 JHB, fix problem with "average stats calc" run-time stat not being displayed correctly
   Modified May 2020 JHB, implement analytics mode improvements in CheckForPacketLossFlush(). Continue to support "analytics compatibility mode" by implementing a separate code path for it
   Modified May 2020 JHB, in ManageSessions() fix integer-out-of-range problem with state_clear_flags that was causing DSSetSessionInfo() with DS_SESSION_INFO_STATE flag to be called every time, even if session state flags had not changed (they change rarely)
   Modified May 2020 JHB, add pm_sync[] flag toggle in pm thread loop
   Modified May 2020 JHB, after call to DSGetOrderedPackets(), implement telecom mode packet loss flush, based on cumulative time vs. cumulative timestamp
   Modified May 2020 JHB, add fFirstGroupContribution[] to fix ptime msec wobble in first contribution to a stream group. See comments near DSMergeStreamGroupContributors()
   Modified Oct 2020 JHB, include codec type and bitrate in run-time stats session description info, other minor changes to run-time stats output. Codec info uses DSGetCodecInfo() API added to voplib
   Modified Oct 2020 JHB, clarify stream change/resume log info message, include new channel in the message

     combined with other Pktlib APIs

  3) Typically the app has to run with raw socket access permissions; i.e. either run as root or a method involving setuid() and CAP_NET_RAW, setcap from the cmd line, or similar to set
     raw socket permissions (as shown here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772068/raw-socket-access-as-normal-user-on-linux-2-4)

     value in msec, and overrides session definition ptime.  In the case of cmd line entry, values less than the ptime value in the input's session definition will cause the
     DS_GETORD_PKT_FTRT flag to be used (FTRT = faster-than-real-time operation).  A value of zero is the fastest possible buffering rate

/* User Managed Sessions notes:

  1) mediaTest uses the ENABLE_MANAGED_SESSIONS define (below) to enable/disable user managed sessions.  The default is disabled

  2) Purpose is to allow sessions to be created with duplicated src/dst IP addr:port values.  This mode of operation requires careful "user management" of session handles,
     i.e. awareness at all times of of which sessions are associated with which incoming packets

  3) In user managed session mode, the user app is responsible for packet input, either socket I/O, pcap files, or other means, keeping track of which packets are associated
     with which sessions, and supplying a valid session handle to APIs such as DSBufferPackets() and DSGetOrderedPackets().  The DSRecvPackets() and DSSendPackets() APIs cannot be used

  2) The application is responsible for opening and closing a og file, and if so, then passing a log file handle within a DEBUG_CONFIG struct
     (uEventLogFile) and giving a pointer to the struct in DSConfigPktlib().  DEBUG_CONFIG is defined in config.h

  3) The log level can be controlled (uLogLevel within a DEBUG_CONFIG struct).  Log levels are defined in config.h (more or less they follow the Linux standard,

/* SigSRF background process notes:

   1) mediaTest uses the ALLOW_BACKGROUND_PROCESS define (below) and use_bkgnd_process var to control the background process.  Defaults are (i) allow use of the process, and (ii) cmd line
      entry enables/disables the process

   2) To enable the background process, a "b" suffix has to be entered after command line mode entry, for example -M0b.  The background process should be enabled only for commands that
      perform packet transcoding (i.e. not including codec test, pcap extract, frame test, etc)

   3) When enabled, the background process directly handles network packet I/O, packet processing, and transcoding.  The background process calls Pktlib and Voplib APIs

   4) When disabled, the user app (e.g. mediaTest) is responsible for calling all Pktlib and Voplib APIs required to handle and process packets

   5) The background process operates in real-time and does not implement several flags, including DS_GETORD_PKT_FTRT, DS_GETORD_PKT_RETURN_ALL_DELIVERABLE, and DS_GETORD_PKT_FLUSH.  The
      background process enables DS_SESSION_DYN_CHAN_ENABLE by default

/* Packet stats log file notes:

  1) If ENABLE_PKT_STATS (below) is defined, and an -L or -Lfilename cmd line entry is given, a packets stats history log file is printed after the test run completes

  2) Packet history stats include:

    -sequence numbers, including missing numbers (gaps)
    -timestamps
    -packet length and special payload types (e.g. DTX)
    -out-of-order (ooo) and missing packets
    -transitions between SSRC streams
    -analysis/comparison of SSRCs and packets between jitter buffer input and output.  Packets are grouped by SSRC for analysis

    a typical log file is divided into three (3) sections, input packets, packets pulled from jitter buffer (if used), and analysis (comparison) between input and pulled packets

  3) Currently packet stats history logging is enabled for the master p/m thread only

  4) Packet stats and logging requires the diaglib module, and diaglib.h header file

  5) DSPktStatsAddEntries() records one or more packet entries in PKT_STATS structs, and DSPktStatsWriteLogFile() writes a specified number of entries to a packet stats history log file (the latter
     API is used in the "cleanup" code below)

      1) A SESSION_DATA struct is required, this can be filled in by user app code, or from external source such as session config files (used here with the mediaTest program).  A
         SESSION_DATA struct contains term1 and term2 TERMINATION_INFO substructs

      2) The DS_SESSION_MODE_IP_PACKET flag indicates that packets will be received and transmitted for the session using IP/UDP/RTP format, either IPv4 or IPv6.  For IPv6, header extensions
         are supported

      3) The DS_SESSION_DYN_CHAN_ENABLE flag enables "dynamic channel creation", which occurs if an SSRC transition is detected in incoming packet flow.  In that case, if a new SSRC appears,
         then a new channel (in addition to the termN channels initially defined in TERMINATION_INFO structs) is created on the fly, along with a new decoder instance.  Currently there is not
         a ratified RFC for "multiple RTP streams within one session", but there is a long history of proposals and recommended guidelines put forward by Magnus Westerlund @ Ericsson and Qin
         Wu @ Huawei (search for RFC 8108)

      4) The DS_SESSION_USER_MANAGED flag allows sessions to be created with partial or all duplication of termN IP addr:port values with other sessions.  In this case, the user app is expected
         to pay careful attention to which packets are associated with which sessions (see additional comments below).  Without this flag, Pktlib handles all packet-to-session matching
         internally using hashing methods

                    1) DSBufferPackets() expects packet headers in network byte order by default.  The DS_PKT_INFO_HOST_BYTE_ORDER flag can be used if headers are in host byte order

                    2) DTX packets are processed, out-of-order packets are handled, and packets duplicated per RFC7198 are stripped out

                    3) For pcap input, DS_BUFFER_PKT_DISABLE_OVERRUN can be set to disable jitter buffer overrun detection, which occurs when the RTP timestamp window is larger than the max delay. 
                       This effectively removes jitter buffer max depth. This flag is typically not used for live network input

                    4) The DS_BUFFER_PKT_DISABLE_PROBATION flag is also intended only for pcap input. This avoids some aspects of jitter buffer "priming" and minmizes loss of initial packets in the pcap.

                  In frame mode, DSBufferPackets() is not called, and payloads are extracted from packets in whatever order and format in which they are read from pcap or received from network socket.  Frame mode notes:

                    1) DTX, out-of-order packets, RFC7198, and SSRC changes are not handled.  If packet input is not a sequential, non-duplicated, single RTP stream representation of original encoded audio frame data
                       prior to network transmission, then resulting decoded audio may contain artifacts or even be completely unintelligible

                    2) Log output, if enabled, does not include jitter buffer stats

                          buffer for that session

                       2) A specific session handle adds packets only for that session

                       3) If the session was created with the DS_SESSION_USER_MANAGED flag, then the session handle _must_ specify the correct session, otherwise the packet won't be added to the buffer.  Situations
                          where DS_SESSION_USER_MANAGED can be useful include creation of sessions with partial or all duplication of termN IP addr:port values with other sessions

                       3) When the DS_GETORD_PKT_FTRT flag is set, on the first call to DSGetOrderedPackets() for each channel, the jitter buffer's internal timestamp offset value is initialized to a time value

                        2) When DTX handling is not enabled, the DS_GETORD_PKT_RETURN_ALL_DELIVERABLE flag is used force all deliverable packets from the previous stream if a new SSRC stream has started.  For DTX handling enabled case, DTX handling inside
                           DSGetOrderedPackets() already does this

                        3) The DS_GETORD_PKT_RETURN_ALL_DELIVERABLE flag forces any packets currently in a jitter buffer to be delivered, given at least one packet is currently in the deliverable time window.  This is different than flushing 
                           (DS_DSGETORD_PKT_FLUSH) which forces out all packets regardless

                        -jitter buffer depth can continue to grow in overrun situations; i.e. the application is pushing packets at a sustained rate exceeding packet ptime (e.g. average packet deltas less than 20 msec)
                        -we need to control jitter buffer memory usage, so we establish nominal packet depth limits, one for analytics mode, another for telecom mode
                        -since analytics mode is data driven, timing is controlled by buffer add time (which causes a buffer pull attempt) so the analytics mode limit is based on a number of packets; i.e. the currently configured max jitter buffer delay. The telecom mode limit is set to an arbitarily large time value
                        -once we hit these limits we start "pulling from future time" to maintain the limit and let streamlib contributor management and other mechanisms handle overrun
                        -to do this, we set the "timestamp advance" flag (DS_GETORD_PKT_ADVANCE_TIMESTAMP), and pull one or more additional times, which causes DSGetOrderedPackets() to look ptime into the future of the channel's jitter buffer
                        -each channel can overrun (hit the limit) independently. streamlib overrun management handles contributor synchronization in overrun situations
                        -jitter buffer packet depth limit is arbitrary. For telecom mode currently the default is 50 ptimes -- let's say there are 512 sessions, each with 3 G711 channels (no SIDs), that would be about 20 MB of mem, so not a problem. Other codecs would be much less 
                        -at session creation time the packet depth limit can be specified with the max_depth_ptimes element of the JITTER_BUFFER_CONFIG struct, which is part of the TERMINATION_INFO struct (both defined in shared_include/session.h)
                        -at run-time the packet depth limit can be specified using DSSetJitterBufferInfo() or directly in TERMINATION_INFOs' JITTER_BUFFER_CONFIG structs

                  1) If DECOUPLE_STREAM_PROCESSING is defined (default setting), then stream processing is decoupled from packet + payload processing above (i.e. two separate loops).  The define can
                     be commented out and stream processing is then combined with packet + payload processing -- but that is not recommended.  Decoupling has key advantages, including (i) ability to
                     handle unequal ptimes, or "transrating", between endpoints, and (ii) serving as an interface to algorithm and signal processing for a particular media type, such as speech
                     recognition, image analytics, etc.  Note that transrating also can be considered as signal processing, using simple delay lines

                  2) The packet + payload processing loop above uses DSStoreStreamData() and the stream processing loop uses DSGetStreamData()

                  3) In this example, stream processing includes sample rate conversion (if needed) and encoding.  Algorithm and domain processing can be inserted before or after sample rate conversion,
                     as needed.  The actual the "media processing insertion point" is where DSConvertFsPacket() is called (sampling rate conversion).  Media processing functions can be inserted either
                     before or after sampling rate conversion, as needed.

                  4) In this example, the loop also includes packet formatting and output

  2) For FTRT timing:
  
    -chnum_map[] values are saved in the input/buffering loop that calls DSBufferPackets().  The values are dynamic, reset each time input streams/queues are processed
  
    -when data runs out in cmd line execution, or the user app flushes a session in thread execution, fDataAvailable goes to false and in that case we use either the last known chnum_map[] values, or the channel number corresponding to the session's term definitions

  3) For real-time (ptime interval) timing:
   
    -chnum_map[] values are not used.  DSGetOrderedPackets() is called independently (and frequently) of the input/buffering loop, and packet timestamps dictate how many packets are returned per session

    -chan_nums[] and num_chan depend solely on the channel number assigned to the sessions's term definition

  4) FTRT timing is enabled when (i) buffer_interval set to zero for thread execution, or (ii) -r0 entry is given for cmd line execution
